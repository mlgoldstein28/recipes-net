# Recipes

Recipes, built through **ReactJS** with **MealDB’s API**, is a culinary site that lets you search recipes by Nationality, Ingredient, Type or Search. **Bootstrap and SASS** were used to implement the UI and UX.

The Navbar contains a link to a Random Recipes page which displays a recipe out of MealDB’s database of recipes. 
This page contains a link to the Full Recipe and a Video (if available).

There are three exclusive filter categories: Nationality, Ingredient, and Type. 
**Pagination** was implemented and 20 meals are displayed per page. 
Selecting a meal will bring you to the MealDetails page, which lists the ingredients 
and also displays a Video and Full Recipe link (if available).

 ***This site is mobile responsive***.
